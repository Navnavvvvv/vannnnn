        <h1>Cloud provisioning</h1>
        <p>Cloud provisioning is the allocation of a cloud provider's resources and services to a customer. It's a key feature of the cloud computing model, relating to how a customer procures cloud services and resources from a cloud provider.</p>
        <div class="function">
            <h2>Features of Cloud Automation</h2>
            <ol id="olf">              
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="Types">
        <h2>5 Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced provisioning</li>
            <p>The customer signs a formal contract of service with the cloud provider. The provider then prepares the agreed-upon resources or services for the customer and delivers them. The customer is charged a flat fee or is billed every month.</p>
            <li>Dynamic provisioning</li>
            <p>Cloud resources are deployed to match a customer's fluctuating demands. Cloud deployments typically scale up to accommodate spikes in usage and scale down when demands decrease. The customer is billed on a pay-per-use basis. When dynamic provisioning is used to create a hybrid cloud environment, it's sometimes referred to as cloud bursting.</p>
            <li>User self-provisioning</li>
            <p>With user self-provisioning, also called cloud self-service, the customer buys resources from the cloud provider through a web interface or portal. This usually involves creating a user account and paying for resources with a credit card. Those resources are then quickly spun up and made available for use -- within hours if not minutes. Examples of this type of cloud provisioning include an employee purchasing cloud-based productivity applications via the Microsoft 365 suite or Google Workspace.</p>
            <li>Scalability</li>
            <p>In the traditional IT provisioning model, an organization makes large investments in its on-premises network infrastructure. This requires extensive preparation and forecasting of infrastructure needs, as the on-premises infrastructure is often set up to last for several years. In the cloud provisioning model, however, organizations can simply scale up and scale down their cloud resources based on short-term usage requirements.</p>
            <li>Potential cost savings</li>
            <p>While traditional on-premises technology can require large upfront investments from an organization, many cloud providers let customers pay for only what they consume. However, the attractive economics presented by cloud services can present its own challenges, which organizations should address in their cloud management strategy.</p>
        </ul>

    <div class="Benefits">
        <h2>3 Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessibility</li>
            <p>Cloud provisioning lets users access cloud-based data and apps from any location using any internet-connected device. This level of accessibility encourages and makes collaboration easier for remote work.</p>
            <li>Disaster recovery</li>
            <p>Cloud computing provides trustworthy backup and disaster recovery options. Data is stored in numerous locations, reducing the risk of data loss in the event of a hardware failure or natural disaster.</p>
            <li>Reduced IT maintenance</li>
            <p>Cloud computing lets businesses delegate the tasks of hardware maintenance, software updates and security patches to the cloud service provider. Organizations can worry less about IT maintenance and instead concentrate on their core business activities.</p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="Challenges">
        <h2>3 challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex management and monitoring</li>
            <p>Organizations might need to rely on multiple provisioning tools to customize how they use cloud resources. Many enterprises also deploy workloads on more than one cloud platform, which makes it even more challenging to have a central console to view everything.</p>
            <li>Resource and service dependencies</li>
            <p> Applications and workloads in the cloud often tap into basic cloud infrastructure resources, such as compute services, networking and storage. Beyond those, public cloud providers' big selling point is in higher-level ancillary services, such as serverless functions, machine learning and big data capabilities. However, those services can carry dependencies that might not be obvious, which can lead to unexpected overuse and surprise costs.</p>
            <li>Policy enforcement</li>
            <p>A self-service provisioning model helps streamline how users request and manage cloud resources but requires strict rules to ensure they don't provision resources they shouldn't. Different groups of users require different levels of access and frequency. For example, a DevOps team might deploy multiple daily updates, while line-of-business users might use self-service provisioning on a quarterly basis. </p>
